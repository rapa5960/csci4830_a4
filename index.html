		<h1> Why I picked CU</h1>
		<p> This is a short explanation/story on how I ended up attending the University of Colorado Boulder.  </p>
		
		<h3> Military Brat</h3>
		<p> Since the day I was born, my dad has been in the United States Air Force.  So, my mom, dad, and 3 other siblings would constantly move to different states every 1-3 years.  In fact, during k-12, I attended 9 different schools.  So, I never got connected to a state and I never grew up thinking, "I'm going to go to that college, because that is where I am from."</p>

		<h3> Family Oriented</h3>
		<p>Because of the constant moving, I never really developed friendships that lasted longer than the time we were stationed in that state.  So my 5 best friends were always my Mom, Dad, 2 sisters, and little brother.  My dad finally retired in 2012 in Colorado Springs.  I was a junior in High School at the time, so I knew I wanted to go to college somewhere close to home.  I started researching what schools in Colorado had a good engineering program.  I was choosing between Colorado School of Mines and CU Boulder.  Visiting Boulder's campus sold me, and that is how I came to attend CU.  It was the best of both worlds, I got some independence being about 2 hours from home, but I could still always go home if I wanted too.  Fast forward 4 years, and I am now a senior getting ready to graduate in May.</p>
